manifold market making (not really just a bot)


## Arb project

The idea is that there are arbitrage opportunities for confident derivative markets[0] that can be taken advantage of. Either this, or it is unlinked multichoice markets with linked outcomes (such as this example of many boolean combinations of the GOP winning Pennsylvania and Gorgia)[1]. The tricky thing is that one has to go and manually link the results together.
